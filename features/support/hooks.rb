#Cucumber provides a number of hooks which allow us to run blocks at various points in the Cucumber test cycle

Before do
  # Do something before each scenario.
end

Before do |scenario|
  # The +scenario+ argument is optional, but if you use it, you can get the title,
  # description, or name (title + description) of the scenario that is about to be
  # executed.
  DatabaseCleaner.clean
end

After do |scenario|
  # Do something after each scenario.
  # The +scenario+ argument is optional, but
  # if you use it, you can inspect status with
  # the #failed?, #passed? and #exception methods.

  if(scenario.failed?)
    #Do something if scenario fails.
  end
end

##Tagged hooks
#
#Before('@Ex_tag1, @Ex_tag2') do
#  # This will only run before scenarios tagged
#  # with @Ex_tag1 OR @Ex_tag2.
#end

#AfterStep('@Ex_tag1, @Ex_tag2') do |scenario|
#  # This will only run after steps within scenarios tagged
#  # with @Ex_tag1 AND @Ex_tag2.
#end

#Around('@Ex_tag1') do |scenario, block|
  # Will round around a scenario
#end

#AfterConfiguration do |config|
#  # Will run after cucumber has been configured
#end

# Quit the selenium driver from the example tests.
